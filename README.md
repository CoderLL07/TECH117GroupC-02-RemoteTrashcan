Auto Trash Can


Problem Statement:
Automatic trash cans use motion sensors to open the lid when someone approaches. However, in high traffic areas like kitchens or offices, the lid may open unnecessarily when people walk by without intending to use it. This leads to excessive battery drain, mechanical wear, and noisy distractions.


Proposed Solution:
Voice activated container lid, so that you can open it with your hands, it'll help with medical scenarios by allowing doctors, surgeons and nurses to store things without having to touch the container and contaminate it
